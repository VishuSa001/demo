            <p class="section-tag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people..</p>

            <p class="section-tag text-small">Education socializes children into society by teaching cultural values and norms. It equips them with the skills needed to become productive members of society. This way, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions affect many aspects of education. For example, governments set education policies. They determine when school classes happen, what is taught, and who can or must attend.</p>

            <p class="section-tag text-small">Theorists from various fields have tried to define education.[1][2][3] Many agree that education is a purposeful activity trying to achieve certain aims. These aims include the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits.[4][1][5] However, there are deep disagreements about its exact nature besides these general features. According to some theorists, it is primarily a process that occurs during events like schooling, teaching, and learning.[6][7][2] Others understand it not as a process but as the product caused by this process. This means that education is what educated persons have..</p>
